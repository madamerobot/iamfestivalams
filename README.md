<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>Iamfestival is your one stop shop for all festivals in Amsterdam, filtered by your neighbourhood.<br>

This page was created based on the needs of three different personas, which we translated into user stories. We then split up these user stories into backlog items and sorted them based on priority (MVP and 'nice to have'). This page was created in a team of three people, each working on their own parts and eventually merging via GitHub.

<h1>Built:</h1>
<p>The page is built with Materialize and jQuery.<br>
